Installation
============

Python libraries (pip install)
    - falcon
    - pycryptodomex
    - requests
    - gunicorn (or waitress for Windows)
    - jsons

Notes
=====

- Windows uses dumb dbm by default, is this a problem?
- waitress-serve doesn't do hot loading out of the box...  Might be a workaround
